#Health_dataset_analysis
This was my first data analysis project. 
Here is what started with:
1. Data Preparation & Cleaning: handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, and making sure the data was clean and ready for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): In the EDA phase, I explored the data both univariately and bivariately to understand how different health factors relate to heart disease.
3. Data Visualisation: created bar charts, pie charts, and correlation heatmaps to clearly show patterns and highlight key relationships between health factors and heart disease.
4. Result: I discovered that factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, higher BMI, and older age are strongly linked to heart disease. I also realized that promoting healthy eating, regular health checkups, and awareness among older adults can help in preventing it.
